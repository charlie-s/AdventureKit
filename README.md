# AdventureKit

### A point-and-click adventure game framework written in Objective C using SpriteKit.

This is primarily a learning exercise, but something useful may come out of it.

## Libraries

[HUMAStarPathfinder](https://github.com/colinhumber/HUMAStarPathfinder)
[JSTileMap](https://github.com/slycrel/JSTileMap)

I'm also using Tiled (http://www.mapeditor.org/) to create the TMX files for the
screens and their blocking walls.
